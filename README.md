## 1. Preface

In the the restaurant industry, efficient order management is crucial for providing quality service and ensuring customer satisfaction. As my client, the Burger Queen restaurant, expanded its operations and experienced an increase in orders, the need for an efficient system became evident.

To meet this demand, it was developed the Burger Queen API, a flexible backend application designed to handle order processing and staff management. This API serves as the backbone of an application that makes the restaurant staff manage orders more easylly, resulting in a smoother workflow and enhanced customer experience.

## 2. Project Summary

The Burger Queen API is a Node.js-based backend solution designed for handling orders in a dynamic restaurant environment. This project was based in the needs of the day to day workflow of the client, looking into streamling the orders process.

**Key Features:**

- Order Processing: Manage incoming orders, track their status, and update in real-time.

- Menu Integration: Integrate the restaurant's menu to facilitate accurate order creation and customization.

- User Authentication: Secure user authentication ensures that only authorized personnel can access and manage orders, and that certains features are for highier roles.

- Scalability: Built with scalability in mind to accommodate the restaurant's expanding operations.

- Real-time Updates: Keep staff informed with real-time updates on order status.
